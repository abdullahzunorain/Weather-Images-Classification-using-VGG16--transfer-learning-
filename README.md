# Weather Images Classification using VGG16 (transfer learning)

This repository contains the code for classifying weather images using the VGG16 model with transfer learning.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to classify images into different weather categories using a deep learning approach. We leverage the pre-trained VGG16 model and fine-tune it for our specific task of weather classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of various weather images categorized into different classes. Each image is labeled with the appropriate weather condition it depicts. The dataset is stored in the `weather_data` directory.

## Project Structure

- `Abdullah Zunorain.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for training and evaluating the model.
- `Weather Images Classification using VGG16 (transfer learning).ipynb`: Another Jupyter notebook with additional experiments and visualizations.
- `weather_data/`: Directory containing the weather images dataset.
- `test.csv`: CSV file containing test data information.
- `weather_classification_model.h5`: Saved model file after training.

## Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following dependencies:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
